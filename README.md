# Base Horizon (Built for Base)

Base Horizon is a browser-first reference repository designed to validate Base wallet connectivity, explicit chain targeting, and read-only inspection of onchain state using official Coinbase and Base tooling. The project emphasizes safety, clarity, and compatibility with account abstraction–ready environments.

---

## Base ecosystem alignment

Built for Base.

Supported networks:
- Base Mainnet  
  chainId (decimal): 8453  
  Explorer: https://basescan.org  

- Base Sepolia  
  chainId (decimal): 84532  
  Explorer: https://sepolia.basescan.org  

The application explicitly targets Base networks by chainId and uses official Base RPC endpoints.

## What the script does

The app.base-horizon.ts script provides an in-browser interface that:

1) Connects a wallet using Coinbase Wallet SDK  
2) Reads and validates the active chainId  
3) Performs read-only Base RPC queries:
   - latest block number  
   - ETH balance of the connected address  
4) Produces a “horizon pulse” snapshot:
   - block number and timestamp  
   - gas usage  
   - fee estimates  
5) Allows ETH balance checks for arbitrary addresses  
6) Prints Basescan links for verification  

No transactions are sent. All operations are read-only.

## Repository structure

- app.base-horizon.ts  
  Browser-based script that connects to a wallet, toggles Base networks, and scans onchain state.

- contracts/  
  Solidity contracts deployed to Base Sepolia for testnet validation:
  - control.sol — minimal contract that handles access control and permissions

- package.json  
  Dependency manifest including Coinbase SDKs and multiple repositories from the Base GitHub organization.

- README.md  
  Technical documentation, Base references, licensing, and testnet deployment records.

---

## Libraries used

- @coinbase/wallet-sdk  
  Wallet connection layer compatible with Coinbase tooling and Base accounts.

- viem  
  RPC client used for Base reads, block inspection, and fee estimation.

- Coinbase GitHub repositories  
  Included as dependencies to reference the broader Coinbase open-source ecosystem.

- Base GitHub repositories  
  Included as dependencies to document linkage with Base tooling and infrastructure.

---

## Installation and execution

Install dependencies using Node.js.  
Serve the project with a modern frontend dev server and open the page in a browser.

Expected result:
- Connected address printed with Basescan link  
- Active chainId displayed (8453 or 84532)  
- Read-only Base RPC data displayed  
- Horizon pulse snapshot available on demand

## Testnet Deployment (Base Sepolia)

As part of pre-production validation, one or more contracts may be deployed to the Base Sepolia test network to confirm correct behavior and tooling compatibility.

Network: Base Sepolia  
chainId (decimal): 84532  
Explorer: https://sepolia.basescan.org  

Contract address:  
0x89787BDAd2f00b91c54FD832a38DcD909B64EF9a

Deployment and verification:
- https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x89787BDAd2f00b91c54FD832a38DcD909B64EF9a
- https://sepolia.basescan.org/0x89787BDAd2f00b91c54FD832a38DcD909B64EF9a/0#code  

These testnet deployments provide a controlled environment for validating Base tooling, account abstraction flows, and read-only onchain interactions prior to Base Mainnet usage.
